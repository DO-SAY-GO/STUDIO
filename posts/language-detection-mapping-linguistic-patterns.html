      <h2>Language Detection: Mapping Linguistic Patterns</h2>
      <p class="author">By <a href="/about.html#cris">Cris</a>, February 1, 2013</p>
      <p>
        I needed to be able to detect the language of a web page to classify it for archiving and scraping. There was no reliable library for doing this at the time, so I wondered if I could achieve this natural task using something I loved and intuitively felt might apply: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch>The Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm</a> or, more accurately in this case, the tokens afforded via <a href=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21458-5_4>"LZ-factorization"</a> of a text. 
      </p>
      <p>The output of this process would be a series of short tokens that were repeated in a text. I reasoned that, for a given human language, a subset of these would converge upon some kind of "fingerprint" of the language, because langauges tend to repeat such morphemes to convey meaning, and do so in distinctive ways. I also felt that this would be a good way to delimit one language from another, because the specific morpheme fingerprint would differ between languages &mdash; French would have the same distribution of morphemes as English for example.</p>
      <p>I manually created per-language corpora for over 100 human languages, and calculated their per language fingerprints using LZ factorization, and then scored a given text based on the similarity between its LZ factorization and the fingerprint for each language, yielding a confidence score that was accurate to a single sentence. That is, if a text (a web page, for example) switched languages mid-paragraph, I could detect where one language ended and another begun with this method.</p>
