      <h2>About STUDIO by DOSAYGO</h2>
      <p>In a forest of code, where paths twist between the tangible and the imagined, I find myself—a traveler named Cris, weaving through the undergrowth of innovation. My journey began with chemistry, but I dreamt of words and worlds I could craft as a writer, a longing that sent me traveling far to seek the experiences that fuel stories. Since I was ten, I’d been coding—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBASIC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.java.com/en/">Java</a>, assembler—a hobby that felt more like home than the sterile air of a lab ever could. Yet, when I graduated in Australia, in boom times, I found no foothold for my codings skills; despite years of crafting code, the software jobs I sought remained paper only, like dry leaves.</p>

      <p id="cris">I turned outward, traveling again, following my roots, until a new path opened—I married and moved to my first wife’s country, where finally I got paid to code: I joined a national research lab as a programmer. There, I delved into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP</a>, crafting systems that cataloged vast data, but lost the poetry of human language. Still, it introduced me to thrill of building living systems. But again it didn't feel right, I was restless, and I set out on my own—first through web agency work, then a startup funded by friends and family, which would become a lesson learned in how the people you think you know sometimes you don't. Sometimes you just saw what you wanted, or needed to see, to survive.</p>
      <p>When that chapter closed, I founded <a href="https://dosaygo.com">DOSAYGO</a>, a name that echoes the pulse of human action—DO-SAY-GO, the three most common verbs in most languages, beside “be,” because I believe a company has no business telling you who you are, but can help you to do, to say, to go where your spirit leads. Follow your heart, and trust yourself, that's been the things that's served me, more than anything else.<p>
      <p>At DOSAYGO, we began with web scraping and authorship tools, but our path soon turned toward cybersecurity and the flow of information, building products like <a href="https://github.com/BrowserBox/BrowserBox">BrowserBox</a> to secure and connect, easing the exchange between individuals, companies, and centers of knowledge. Each project is a clearing in the forest, a place where ideas take root and grow, as naturally as sunlight finds its way through the leaves.</p>
      <p>Welcome to STUDIO, the blog of <a href="https://dosaygo.com">DOSAYGO</a>—a map of those clearings, a collection of hacks, tools, products, and experiments, each a story of creativity and invention. It’s an incomplete list, spanning fifteen years of my work, chosen by what stirs my heart today. Here, you’ll find my explorations alongside DOSAYGO’s creations, from minimalist frameworks to retro visualizations, each a step on a path that winds through the web’s vast expanse. Like clouds drifting above, these works carry no hurry, only presence, offering a quiet joy to those who pause to look, a reminder that in creation, as in nature, there is a home within the world’s wide arms.</p>
