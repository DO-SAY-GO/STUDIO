      <h2>The Killer App of AI: Personalization</h2>
      <p class="author">By <a href="/about.html#cris">Cris</a>, May 8, 2025</p>
      <p>I’ve been thinking about AI products, like an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-personalization">AI debugger</a> with a structured way to find bugs. But that’s missing the point. The killer app for AI, to me, is personalization. AI should know you better than you know yourself. It should teach you things about yourself through how you interact with it, reflecting your interests back to you.</p>
      <p>Recommendation algorithms, like those on <a href="https://www.netflix.com/">Netflix</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, aren’t truly intelligent, but they get your interests in a way. AI should go deeper, knowing everything about you. It should personalize itself to fit you like a glove—your perfect assistant, anticipating what you want before you say it.</p>
      <p>Something like <a href="https://x.ai/grok">Grok</a> is great, but it’s raw intelligence, not shaped to you. What’s the point of smarts if it’s not coming from someone you vibe with? Over time, AI has to learn you, adapt to who you are. It shouldn’t just be a talking encyclopedia—it should anticipate, understand, and connect with you. That’s the real deal for AI. It should truly grok you.</p>
      <p>Ultimately the idea of entering custom instructions is ridiculous. It should learn from your interactions over time seamlessly.</p>
